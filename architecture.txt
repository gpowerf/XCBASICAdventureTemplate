* Intro:
************************************************************************

This document describes the architecture of the text adventure. 

This is not a complete game, it is a template that can be extended to 
create a complete game in XC=BASIC V2. 

There's no way to finish this game. You can move around the small 
world, get and drop objects, as well as look at things. 

************************************************************************
* Map:
************************************************************************

This is the map of rooms:

      .---.       .---.          N(0)
      | 0 |-------| 1 |            |
      '---'       '---'      W(2)--+--E(3)    
        |                          |
        |                        S(1)
      .---.
      | 2 |
      '---'

Room 1 has two exits, to the east is room 2 and to the south is room 3.
Room 2 has one exit, to the west is room 1.
Room 3 has one exit, to the north is room 1.

This is represented as an array:

ROOM	NAME	N(0)	S(1)	W(2)	E(3)
0       park     -1   	  2   	 -1   	  1
1       shop     -1   	 -1   	  0   	 -1
2       home      0   	 -1   	 -1   	 -1

As you can see each room has 4 exists and the connections are stored in
the matrix. And -1 indicates that there are no exists in that direction. 

In Basic this is represented as an array l (locations):

	rem *** Map ***
	dim l![3, 4]
	l![0,0] = 255:l![0,1] = 2:l![0,2] = 255:l![0,3] = 1
	l![1,0] = 255:l![1,1] = 255:l![1,2] = 0:l![1,3] = 255
	l![2,0] = 0:l![2,1] = 255:l![2,2] = 255:l![2,3] = 255

************************************************************************
* Room descriptions:
************************************************************************

For the room descriptions we also use an array. Remember we have rooms 
0, 1, and 2. A simple array with as many elements as there are rooms.

	rem *** Description of locations ***
	dim d$[3]
	d$[0] = "a city park. It is a bright day and you can see people enjoying the park."
	d$[1] = "a corner shop. It seems to be stocked with all sorts of items."
	d$[2] = "your home."

************************************************************************
* Objects & object descriptions:
************************************************************************

Objects and descriptions are stored in two arrays as follows:

Array 1:
ID	ROOM	
0	0		
1	0		
2	2	

In code:

	rem *** Location of objects ***
	dim obl![3]
	obl![0] = 0  
	obl![1] = 0 
	obl![2] = 2 

Array 1:
ID	NAME	DESCRIPTION
0	candle	an old red candle.
1	bottle	an empty milk bottle.
2	key		a shinny golden key.

In code:

	rem *** Objects, description, locations ***
	dim ob$[3, 2]
	ob$[0,0]="candle":ob$[0,1]="An old red candle."
	ob$[1,0]="bottle":ob$[1,1]="An empty milk bottle."
	ob$[2,0]="key":ob$[2,1]="A shinny golden key."

So these two arrays represent the following: 
	
Object 0 is a candle and it is in the park. 
Object 1 is a bottle and it is in the park. 
Object 2 is a key at it is at home.

There is also another location which is 255, this is your bag, an object
that you are carrying. This is how the inventory is powered. 

When you get an object the location is set to 255.

When you drop an object the location is set to lc!. 

************************************************************************
* Global variables:
************************************************************************

The game uses a number of global variable, primarily the variable lc!, 
this is your current location. 

You may also want to keep a number of flags to indicate that certain
events have happened, eg: imagine a closed cabinet, you could have a 
variable to indicate that it is closed, and an object only becomes 
visible when you open it. 

************************************************************************
* Game loop:
************************************************************************

This is where the magic happens, the game look runs continuously during
your adventure time. There's no game ending in this template, the only 
way to exit this loop is by typing the quit command. 

************************************************************************
* Natural language:
************************************************************************

I've kept things simple here, the game accepts commands of or or two
words only, much like Colossal Cave Adventure.

It makes use of the mid$, left$, and right$ functions to separate the
input string. This is done within the main loop, if you wanted to come
up with more complex natural language processing you might want to
write this as a function instead. 

************************************************************************
* Variables and constants:
************************************************************************

lc! - current location
O!  - number of objects
inlen - the length of the command the player can type in

..... more to come ......
