* Intro:
************************************************************************

This document describes the architecture of the text adventure. 

This is not a complete game, it is a template that can be extended to 
create a complete game in XC=BASIC V2. 

There's no way to finish this game. You can move around the small 
world, get and drop objects, as well as look at things. 

************************************************************************
* Map:
************************************************************************

This is the map of rooms:

      .---.       .---.          N(0)
      | 0 |-------| 1 |            |
      '---'       '---'      W(2)--+--E(3)    
        |                          |
        |                        S(1)
      .---.       .---.
      | 2 |---x---| 3 |
      '---'       '---'

Room 0 has two exits, to the east is room 2 and to the south is room 3.
Room 1 has one exit, to the west is room 1.
Room 2 has one exit, to the north is room 1.
Room 3 has one exit, to the west. x is a locked door.

This is represented as an array:

ROOM	NAME	N(0)	S(1)	W(2)	E(3)
0       park     -1   	  2   	 -1   	  1
1       shop     -1   	 -1   	  0   	 -1
2       home      0   	 -1   	 -1   	 -1

As you can see each room has 4 exists and the connections are stored in
the matrix. And -1 indicates that there are no exists in that direction. 

In Basic this is represented as an array l (locations):

	rem *** Map ***
	dim l![4, 4]
	l![0,0] = 255:l![0,1] = 2:l![0,2] = 255:l![0,3] = 1
	l![1,0] = 255:l![1,1] = 255:l![1,2] = 0:l![1,3] = 255
	l![2,0] = 0:l![2,1] = 255:l![2,2] = 255:l![2,3] = 255
	l![3,0] = 255:l![3,1] = 255:l![3,2] = 255:l![3,3] = 255
	
The map is dynamic, it can change when certain things happen. For 
example, when the door is oppened the map looks like this:

	rem *** Map ***
	dim l![4, 4]
	l![0,0] = 255:l![0,1] = 2:l![0,2] = 255:l![0,3] = 1
	l![1,0] = 255:l![1,1] = 255:l![1,2] = 0:l![1,3] = 255
	l![2,0] = 0:l![2,1] = 255:l![2,2] = 255:l![2,3] = 3
	l![3,0] = 255:l![3,1] = 255:l![3,2] = 2:l![3,3] = 255

************************************************************************
* Room descriptions:
************************************************************************

For the room descriptions we also use an array. Remember we have rooms 
0, 1, and 2. A simple array with as many elements as there are rooms.

	rem *** Description of locations ***
	dim d$[4]
	d$[0] = "a city park. It is a bright day and you can see people enjoying the park."
	d$[1] = "a corner shop. It seems to be stocked with all sorts of items."
	d$[2] = "your house is to the east."
	d$[3] = "ypu are inside your tiny house, it is so small it is just one room."

************************************************************************
* Objects & object descriptions:
************************************************************************

Objects and descriptions are stored in two arrays as follows:

Array 1:
ID	ROOM	
0	0		
1	0		
2	2	

In code:

	rem *** Location of objects ***
	dim obl![3]
	obl![0] = 0  
	obl![1] = 0 
	obl![2] = 2 

Array 1:
ID	NAME	DESCRIPTION
0	candle	an old red candle.
1	bottle	an empty milk bottle.
2	key		a shinny golden key.

In code:

	rem *** Objects, description, locations ***
	dim ob$[3, 2]
	ob$[0,0]="candle":ob$[0,1]="An old red candle."
	ob$[1,0]="bottle":ob$[1,1]="An empty milk bottle."
	ob$[2,0]="key":ob$[2,1]="A shinny golden key."

So these two arrays represent the following: 
	
Object 0 is a candle and it is in the park. 
Object 1 is a bottle and it is in the park. 
Object 2 is a key at it is at home.

There is also another location which is 255, this is your bag, an object
that you are carrying. This is how the inventory is powered. 

When you get an object the location is set to 255.

When you drop an object the location is set to lc!. 

************************************************************************
* Interactive fixtures:
************************************************************************

These are parts of the room you can interact with, fixtures like doors,
windows, cabinets, etc... These are objects that in the game normally
have two states, eg:

Door - Locked, unlocked
TV   - On, off
Box	 - Open, close	

These are represented as follows: 

Array 1:
	ID	NAME	VERB 0	VERB 1	NOUN	LOOK DESCRIPTION					EXAMINE DESCRIPTION 0					EXAMINE DESCRIPTION 1		ACTION MESSAGE 0			ACTION MESSAGE 0
	0	TV		use		use		TV		There's a TV on a table.			an old CRT TV, it is switched off.		the TV is now on.			"you turned the TV off."	"you turned the TV on."
	1	door	use		use		key		You can see the door from here.		a metal door, it is locked.				the door is now unlocked.	"you locked the door."		"you unlocked the door."
	2	box		open	close	box		There's a box under the table.		a wooden box, it is closed.				the box is open and empty.	"you closed the box."		"you opened the box."
	
In code:

	rem *** Interactive fixtures ***
	dim sf$[3, 8]
	sf$[0,0]="tv"  :sf$[0,1]="use" :sf$[0,2]="use"    :sf$[0,3]=" There's a TV on a table."       			     :sf$[0,4]="an old CRT TV, it is switched off." :sf$[0,5]="the TV is now on."         :sf$[0,6]="you turned the TV off." :sf$[0,7]="you turned the TV on." 
	sf$[1,0]="door":sf$[1,1]="open" :sf$[1,2]="close" :sf$[1,3]=" You can see the front door from here."		 :sf$[1,4]="a metal door, it is closed."        :sf$[1,5]="the door is now open."     :sf$[1,6]="you closed the door."   :sf$[0,7]="you opened the door."
	sf$[2,0]="key" :sf$[2,1]="open":sf$[2,2]="close"  :sf$[2,3]=" There's a box under the table, it has a lock." :sf$[2,4]="a wooden box, it is closed."        :sf$[2,5]="the box is open and empty.":sf$[2,6]="you closed the box."    :sf$[0,7]="you closed the box."

Array 2 is used to store the current state as well as the custom routine that should be run when there's a change of state. 

Array 2:
	ID	ROOM	STATE  CUSTOM ROUTINE 1   CUSTOM ROUTINE 1
	0	3		0		255					255
	1	2		0		1					2
	2	3		0		255					255
	
In code:

	rem *** Location and state ***
	dim sfl![3,4]
	sfl![0,0] = 0 :sfl![0,1] = 0:sfl![0,2] = 255: sfl![0,3] = 255
	sfl![1,0] = 0 :sfl![1,1] = 0:sfl![1,2] = 0  : sfl![1,3] = 1
	sfl![2,0] = 2 :sfl![2,1] = 0:sfl![2,2] = 255: sfl![2,3] = 255


************************************************************************
* Global variables:
************************************************************************

The game uses a number of global variable, primarily the variable lc!, 
this is your current location. 

You may also want to keep a number of flags to indicate that certain
events have happened, eg: imagine a closed cabinet, you could have a 
variable to indicate that it is closed, and an object only becomes 
visible when you open it. 

************************************************************************
* Game loop:
************************************************************************

This is where the magic happens, the game look runs continuously during
your adventure time. There's no game ending in this template, the only 
way to exit this loop is by typing the quit command. 

************************************************************************
* Natural language:
************************************************************************

I've kept things simple here, the game accepts commands of or or two
words only, much like Colossal Cave Adventure.

It makes use of the mid$, left$, and right$ functions to separate the
input string. This is done within the main loop, if you wanted to come
up with more complex natural language processing you might want to
write this as a function instead. 

************************************************************************
* Variables and constants:
************************************************************************

lc! - current location
O!  - number of objects
inlen - the length of the command the player can type in

..... more to come ......
